# Genetic Syndrome Classification

**Context**
You are being hired by a fictional biotech company specializing in genetic research. The task involves analyzing embeddings derived from images to classify genetic syndromes. These embeddings are outputs from a pre-trained classification model. The company wants to improve its understanding of the data distribution and enhance the classification accuracy of genetic syndromes based on these
embeddings.
Your objective is to implement a comprehensive pipeline that includes data preprocessing, visualization, classification, manual implementation of key metrics, and insightful analysis.

## Prerequisites

You must have installed:
- Python 3.11.10

Optional:
- UV

## Setup

In the root of the project you must run:
```bash
# If you have python UV installed
uv sync

# If you have only pyhton and pip installed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Open a terminal and execute:

```bash
# If you have UV installed
uv run main.py

# Or
python3 main.py
```

After you run the command above, it will create a folder called `artifact` containing the results of the executed code.
